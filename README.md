### IoT & Edge Computing
- **Compromised ASUS routers** in DDoS attacks
- **Edge device vulnerabilities** exploited at scale
- **BYOD risks** amplified by new technologies

---

## Key Recommendations Summary

1. **Patch edge devices immediately** - Median 0-day to exploit
2. **Enforce MFA everywhere** - Especially for third-party services
3. **Monitor for stolen credentials** - 54% of ransomware victims had credentials in infostealer logs
4. **Vet third-party vendors** - 30% breach involvement
5. **Implement network segmentation** - Limit lateral movement
6. **Focus on detection, not just prevention** - Assume credentials may be compromised
7. **Train employees continuously** - Focus on reporting, not just click prevention
8. **Secure code repositories** - 94-day median to remediate leaked secrets
9. **Plan for ransomware** - Have offline backups, don't assume you won't be hit
10. **Collaborate with law enforcement** - Essential for disruption operations

---

## Conclusion

The 2025 DBIR reveals a threat landscape dominated by opportunistic ransomware attacks, sophisticated state-sponsored espionage, and the growing complexity of third-party risk. Attackers are increasingly exploiting edge device vulnerabilities and stolen credentials at scale, with median time-to-exploit measured in days or hours. Small businesses face disproportionate ransomware impact, while all organizations must contend with the expanding attack surface created by cloud services, supply chain dependencies, and emerging technologies like GenAI. Effective defense requires rapid patching, strong authentication, continuous monitoring, and collaboration between private sector and law enforcement.

### 5. IOCs
The report is a high-level strategic overview and **does not contain** specific technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like file hashes, IP addresses, or domains.

### 6. Attack Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
*   **Initial Access:**
    *   **Social Engineering:** A massive shift towards human-centric attacks. Vishing (voice phishing) attacks grew 442% in H2 2024.
    *   **Help Desk Social Engineering:** Impersonating employees to persuade IT help desk staff to reset passwords and MFA.
    *   **Callback Phishing:** Lure emails (e.g., fake invoices) prompt the victim to call a number, initiating a social engineering interaction.
    *   **Access Brokerage:** The business of selling initial access to networks is booming, with advertisements up 50% year-over-year.
*   **Lateral Movement & Execution:**
    *   **Malware-Free Attacks:** 79% of detections were malware-free, relying on hands-on-keyboard techniques and legitimate tools (e.g., RMM tools like Microsoft Quick Assist, PowerShell, curl).
    *   **Rapid Breakout Time:** The average time for an eCrime adversary to move laterally from initial compromise fell to just 48 minutes, with the fastest observed at 51 seconds.
    *   **Cloud-Conscious Tactics:** Abusing valid cloud accounts (35% of cloud incidents), exploiting cloud misconfigurations, and using cloud management tools for lateral movement.
*   **Defense Evasion & Persistence:**
    *   **Indicator Removal:** Deleting or modifying logs and emails to hide malicious activity.
    *   **Legitimate Tool Abuse:** Using trusted software like RMM tools to blend in with normal administrative activity.
    *   **Backdoor Accounts:** Creating new user accounts (as seen with CURLY SPIDER) to ensure persistent access.
*   **Use of Generative AI (GenAI):**
    *   **Social Engineering:** FAMOUS CHOLLIMA used GenAI to create fake LinkedIn profiles and plausible interview responses. Deepfake video and voice clones were used in BEC fraud.
    *   **Malicious Content Creation:** Used to generate content for spam campaigns (Snake Keylogger), destructive PowerShell scripts (APT INC), and decoy websites (NITRO SPIDER).

### 7. Short summary of entire content
The CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report identifies the "enterprising adversary" as the central theme for 2024â€”threat actors are becoming more efficient, business-like, and innovative. A major trend is the dramatic shift from malware-based attacks to human-focused social engineering, with vishing and help desk impersonation skyrocketing. Consequently, 79% of observed intrusions were malware-free. Adversary speed has reached an all-time high, with the average eCrime "breakout time" dropping to 48 minutes. Nation-state activity also surged, with China-nexus intrusions increasing by 150%. North Korea's FAMOUS CHOLLIMA perfected a large-scale IT worker scheme to generate revenue and gain insider access. Generative AI has become a key tool for adversaries, used to enhance social engineering, create deepfakes for BEC fraud, and generate malicious content. The report emphasizes that adversaries are increasingly targeting identities and exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud and network perimeter devices.

### 8. Recommendation/ recommended actions
The report provides five main recommendations for defenders:
1.  **Secure the entire identity ecosystem:** Adopt phishing-resistant MFA (like hardware keys), enforce strong IAM policies, and use identity threat detection tools.
2.  **Eliminate cross-domain visibility gaps:** Modernize detection with XDR and next-gen SIEM to correlate suspicious behaviors across endpoints, cloud, and identity systems.
3.  **Defend the cloud as core infrastructure:** Use Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs) with cloud detection and response (CDR) to counter misconfigurations and stolen credential abuse.
4.  **Prioritize vulnerabilities with an adversary-centric approach:** Focus patching on critical internet-facing services (web servers, VPNs) and use exposure management tools to identify the vulnerabilities that matter most.
5.  **Know your adversary and be prepared:** Use threat intelligence to understand attacker TTPs, conduct user awareness training, and perform tabletop and red/blue team exercises.

### 9. Detection Techniques
*   **Real-time Threat Detection:** Essential to counter the rapid breakout times of modern adversaries.
*   **Proactive Threat Hunting:** Use intelligence-led hunting (like CrowdStrike OverWatch) to identify pre-attack behaviors and suspicious activity that evades automated defenses.
*   **User Behavior-Based Monitoring:** Implement solutions to detect anomalies in user activity, especially in SaaS and cloud environments.
*   **Cross-Domain Correlation:** Use XDR and next-gen SIEM platforms to connect disparate alerts from endpoints, cloud, and identity systems to see the full attack path.
*   **Monitoring for Social Engineering Indicators:** Monitor for unusual MFA reset requests (especially outside business hours) and multiple users registering the same device for MFA.

### 10. Prevention techniques
*   **Phishing-Resistant MFA:** Implement hardware-based FIDO2 devices (e.g., YubiKeys) or number matching to prevent MFA bypass.
*   **Strong Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Enforce strong password policies, implement least-privilege principles, and conduct regular audits of user permissions.
*   **User Education:** Train employees to recognize vishing, phishing, and other social engineering tactics. Train help desk staff to be cautious with reset requests and require stronger forms of identity verification (e.g., video authentication).
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Aggressively patch critical systems, especially internet-facing network appliances.
*   **Secure SaaS Configuration:** Regularly review and update SaaS application settings and disable unnecessary features or integrations.
